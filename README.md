# SDN for mobility
Project for the Advanced Network Architectures and Wireless Systems course of the Master of Science 
in Computer Engineering, University of Pisa.

The project consists in the design and implementation of a Floodlight module supporting mobility of users
inside a network domain.


## Overview
The repository is organized in the following way:
- _floodlight_ contains the source code of the Floodlight controller, where 
  the custom module is located in the _it.unipi.floodlight_ package. No additional changes to the
  source code of the controller were introduced.
- _mininet_ contains the scripts to generate the test topology in Mininet-WiFi and
  to inject the configuration in the controller via the REST interface.
- _asciimation-over-http_ contains a test application simulating a video 
  streaming between a client and a server.
  
The test topology is the one of the following figure:

## Requirements
- Floodlight requires Java 7 and Ant. The latter must support Java 7 (ex. version 1.9.X).
- Mininet-WiFi can be installed following the instructions in its [repository](https://github.com/intrig-unicamp/mininet-wifi).
- The test application and the script to inject the configuration in the controller require Python 3. 
  The required packages can be installed with pip:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
  If the nodes in Mininet-Wifi do not see the Flask package during the execution, please install it via apt:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install python3-flask
    ```

## Installation and execution
- Compile and execute Floodlight. In the _floodlight_ folder:
    ```bash
    ant
    sudo java -jar target/floodlight.jar
    ```
- Build the topology using Mininet-WiFi. In the _mininet_ folder:
    ```bash
    sudo python topology_generator.py
    ```
- If you don't want to load manually or customise the configuration in the controller, inject the provided one. 
  The script adds 3 users (sta1, sta2, sta3), the servers (h1, h2, h3) and the access
  switches (s1, s3, s5). In the _mininet_ folder:
  ```bash
  python configuration_injection.py
  ``` 
- Start the server application in the mininet nodes representing the servers (the contacted server
  is always the topologically closest one). For example, inside h1, execute in the _asciimation-over-http_ folder:
  ```bash
  python server/movieserver.py --serverIP=10.0.1.1 --serverPort=5000
  ```
- Start the client application in one mininet node representing a station, targeting the virtual IP exposed 
  by Floodlight (by default 8.8.8.8). For example, inside sta1, execute in the _asciimation-over-http_ folder:
  ```bash
  python client/movieclient.py --movie=starwars --serverIP=8.8.8.8 --serverPort=5000
  ```
- Enjoy the movie!

The scripts inside _mininet_ assume that the controller is running locally at 127.0.0.1,
allowing the exchange of Openflow messages through the port 6653 and exposing the REST interface
through the port 8080.

> **WARNING**: if an access switch is shut down or the topology is reloaded while the controller
> is still running, the involved access switch(es) must be removed from the list of access switches and 
> registered again using the REST interface. This operation is necessary to initialize properly their 
> flow tables; it is not necessary for the core switches.

## Mobility scenario
A station can be moved spatially in two ways:
- _instantaneously_, operating on the Mininet-WiFi command line.
  For example, sta1 can be moved near ap2 with the command:
  ```
  mininet-wifi> py sta1.setPosition("60,30,0")
  ```
- _gradually_, adding custom lines inside the _topology_generator.py_ file.
  For example, sta1 can start moving towards ap2, when the topology is loaded,
  adding the lines:
  ```
  ...
  net.plotGraph(max_x=100, max_y=100)
  
  # Start mobility code.
  net.startMobility(time=0, ac_method="ssf")
  net.mobility(sta1, "start", time=30, position="15,30,0")
  net.mobility(sta1, "stop", time=40, position="60,30,0")
  net.stopMobility(time=45)
  # End mobility code.
  
  info("*** Starting network\n")
  net.build()
  ...
  ```
  This example is contained in _topology_generator_with_mobility.py_.
